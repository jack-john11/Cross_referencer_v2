- **Tablet:** Touch-optimized with larger targets, gesture support for panel switching
- **Mobile:** Thumb-friendly navigation, simplified file upload, read-only progress view

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Motion:** All animations serve a functional purpose - progress indication, state transitions, or user feedback. No decorative animations that could distract from professional work.

**Performance Conscious:** Lightweight animations that don't impact the performance of long-running AI processes. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting.

**Natural Feel:** Subtle, organic easing that reflects the natural, earthy brand aesthetic. Avoid overly mechanical or bouncy animations.

**Progress-Focused:** Emphasis on animations that help users understand long processes and system states.

### Key Animations

- **File Upload Progress:** Smooth progress bar with organic easing (Duration: 200-2000ms depending on file size, Easing: ease-out)
- **Panel Transitions:** Smooth sliding/fading when collapsing/expanding panels (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **AI Callout Appearance:** Gentle fade-in with subtle slide for AI questions (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Generation Progress:** Pulsing progress indicators with color transitions (Duration: 1500ms, Easing: ease-in-out, infinite)
- **Section Completion:** Satisfying checkmark animation when sections complete (Duration: 600ms, Easing: ease-out with slight bounce)
- **Focus Transitions:** Smooth focus ring transitions for keyboard navigation (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Hover States:** Subtle scale/color transitions on interactive elements (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Glass Header Blur:** Dynamic backdrop-filter adjustments on scroll (Duration: 100ms, Easing: linear)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial dashboard load under 2 seconds on standard connections
- **Interaction Response:** UI interactions respond within 100ms even during AI processing
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations, especially during background processing

### Design Strategies

**Progressive Loading:** 
- Load critical three-panel layout first, then enhance with advanced features
- Lazy load file preview components and advanced AI settings
- Progressive enhancement for complex visualizations

**Background Process Isolation:**
- Ensure UI remains fully responsive during 5-20 minute AI generation
- Use Web Workers or service workers for file processing where possible
- Implement proper loading states that don't block user interaction

**Efficient File Handling:**
- Stream large file uploads with chunked progress indicators
- Optimize file preview generation to avoid blocking main thread
- Implement client-side file validation before upload

**Memory Management:**
- Careful cleanup of large file objects after upload
- Efficient rendering of long report sections
- Optimize component re-renders during progress updates

**Network Optimization:**
- Implement smart polling for progress updates (start frequent, reduce over time)
- Use server-sent events for real-time AI clarification questions
- Optimize bundle splitting for faster initial load
