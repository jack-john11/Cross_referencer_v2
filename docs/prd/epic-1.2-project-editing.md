# Epic 1.2: Project Editing and Details Management - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

To allow users to edit the core details of an existing project (name, description, location) so they can correct mistakes or update project information as circumstances change.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current relevant functionality:** The system currently allows users to create new projects and view a list of projects on a dashboard, as well as see a detailed view of a single project.
- **Technology stack:** Next.js, React, Zustand for state management, Firebase/Firestore for the backend.
- **Integration points:** This enhancement will integrate with the existing project details page (`/projects/[id]`), the Zustand store (`project-management.ts`), and the `updateProject` Firebase Function endpoint.

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added/changed:** An "Edit" button on the project details page will navigate to a new edit page (`/projects/[id]/edit`). This page will feature a form, pre-populated with the project's current data, allowing users to modify the name, description, and location.
- **How it integrates:** The edit form will leverage the existing `updateProject` action in the Zustand store, which in turn calls the corresponding `updateProject` API endpoint. It is a direct and logical extension of the existing architecture.
- **Success criteria:** A user can successfully save changes to a project's name, description, and location. The updated information is immediately visible on the project details page and the main dashboard upon saving.

## Stories

1.  **Story 1.2.1: Implement Project Edit UI** - As a user, I can navigate to an edit page for a project and see a form pre-filled with its current details.
2.  **Story 1.2.2: Handle Project Update Logic** - As a user, I can submit the edit form to update the project's information, with changes reflected across the application.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (utilizes existing `updateProject` endpoint).
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no schema changes required).
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (form will reuse styles from the create project page).
- [x] Performance impact is minimal.

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Low. The main risk involves data validation failure or a poor user experience if the update process is not smooth.
- **Mitigation:** This risk is mitigated by reusing the same robust Zod validation schema and form components from the "Create Project" feature.
- **Rollback Plan:** Low risk. A rollback would involve a manual data correction in the Firestore database in the unlikely event of a malformed update.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Existing project creation and viewing functionality verified through testing to ensure no regressions.
- [ ] Integration points (UI -> Store -> API) are working correctly.
- [ ] Documentation is updated if any reusable components or patterns were changed.
- [ ] No regression in existing features.
